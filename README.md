# WebTetris
This is a very simple version of the game Tetris.
    
#### Controls

      move piece side to side:    left/right arrows
      rotate piece:               up arrow
      drop pieve to bottom:       down arrow
     
     
This was a project that a teammate from Learner's Guild and I put together using Node JS, Webpack, React, and Redux.
As we had five days to build the game, and both were still becoming familiar with React, I took out some of the 
extra/half-finished features. It was originally two-player and we were in the process of implementing a 'meteor' feature
which would enable players to drop extra pieces into their opponents game based on the number of lines they complete.
